# RecoNmap
A port scanner and light vulnerability scanner in python. Based on Nmap and Nmap scripts

# Goal
I created it to assist me in passing the OSCP certification as students are not authorized to use existing automated tools and vulnerability scanners.

Due to the time constraint with the lab access, the code is not optimized neither really clean :) 

# Bugs
Please report any bug you can find with details to reproduce it.

# Improvements
List of improvements:
* Option arguments: simplify the current options and add more options (discrete mode)
* Increase performance
* Detection evasion with Nmap options
* Data representation (i.e. through Elastic and Kibana or others)

# Usages and restrictions
This tools is purely for educational purposes. I cannot be held responsible for any illegal actions you perform with it. Do not use it on systems you do not have the authorization to test. Do not use it on production or critical systems.
